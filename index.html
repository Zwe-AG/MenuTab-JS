            <h1>Hello Myanmar</h1>
            <p>Myanmar,officially the Republic of the Union of Myanmar (Burmese: ပြည်ထောင်စု သမ္မတ
                မြန်မာနိုင်ငံတော်‌, also known as Burma,is a country in
                Southeast Asia. It is the largest country in Mainland Southeast Asia, and has a population of about 54
                million as of 2017. Myanmar is bordered by Bangladesh and India to its northwest, China to its
                northeast, Laos and Thailand to its east and southeast, and the Andaman Sea and the Bay of Bengal to its
                south and southwest. The country's capital city is Naypyidaw, and its largest city is Yangon
                (Rangoon).Early civilisations in the area included the Tibeto-Burman-speaking Pyu city-states in
                Upper Myanmar and the Mon kingdoms in Lower Myanmar.[11] In the 9th century, the Bamar people entered
                the upper Irrawaddy valley, and following the establishment of the Pagan Kingdom in the 1050s, the
                Burmese language, culture, and Theravada Buddhism slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan
                Kingdom fell to Mongol invasions, and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by
                the Taungoo dynasty, the country became the largest empire in the history of Southeast Asia for a short
                period.</p>

            <h1>Hello Thailand</h1>
            <p>Thailand historically known as Siam
                and officially the Kingdom of Thailand, is a country in Southeast Asia spanning 513,120 square
                kilometres (198,120 sq mi), with a population of almost 70 million.[6] It is bordered to the north by
                Myanmar and Laos, to the east by Laos and Cambodia, to the south by the Gulf of Thailand and Malaysia,
                and to the west by the Andaman Sea and Myanmar. Thailand also shares maritime borders with Vietnam to
                the southeast, and Indonesia and India to the southwest. Thailand has experienced multiple coups and
                military dictatorships. Since 2019, Thailand has been nominally a parliamentary constitutional monarchy.
                In practice, however, structural advantages in the constitution have ensured the military's hold on
                power.[13] Bangkok is the nation's capital and largest city.
                Tai peoples migrated from southwestern China to mainland Southeast Asia from the 11th century.
                Indianised kingdoms such as the Mon, Khmer Empire and Malay states ruled the region, competing with Thai
                states such as the Kingdoms of Ngoenyang, Sukhothai, Lan Na and Ayutthaya, which also rivalled each
                other. European contact began in 1511 with a Portuguese diplomatic mission to Ayutthaya, which became a
                regional power by the end of the 15th century. Ayutthaya reached its peak during cosmopolitan Narai's
                reign, gradually declining thereafter until being ultimately destroyed in the Burmese Siamese War.
                Taksin quickly reunified the fragmented territory and established the short-lived Thonburi Kingdom. He
                was succeeded in 1782 by Buddha Yodfa Chulaloke, the first monarch of the current Chakri dynasty. </p>

                of 125.5 million on narrow coastal plains. Japan is divided into 47 administrative prefectures and eight
                traditional regions. The Greater Tokyo Area is the most populous metropolitan area in the world, with

                million, Malaysia is the world's 44th-most populous country. The southernmost point of continental
                Eurasia is in Tanjung Piai. In the tropics, Malaysia is one of 17 megadiverse countries, home to
                numerous endemic species.
                Malaysia has its origins in the Malay kingdoms which, from the 18th century, became subject to the
                British Empire. </p>

            <h1>Hello Singapore</h1>
            <p>Singapore officially the Republic of Singapore, is a sovereign island country
                and city-state in maritime Southeast Asia. It lies about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85
                miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of
                Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south, the South China Sea to the east and the Straits
                of Johor to the north. The country's territory is composed of one main island, 63 satellite islands and
                islets, and one outlying islet, the combined area of which has increased by 25% since the country's
                independence as a result of extensive land reclamation projects. It has the third highest population
                density in the world. With a multicultural population and recognising the need to respect cultural
                identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four official languages; English,
                Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. English is the lingua franca and numerous public services are available only
                in English. Multiracialism is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape national policies in
                education, housing, and politics.

                Singapore's history dates back at least a millennium, having been a maritime emporium known as Temasek
                and subsequently as a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. </p>
